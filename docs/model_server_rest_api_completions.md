## API Reference
OpenVINO Model Server includes now the `completions` endpoint using OpenAI API.
Please see the [OpenAI API Reference](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions) for more information on the API.
The endpoint is exposed via a path:

<b>http://server_name:port/v3/completions</b>

    "model": "llama3",
    "prompt": "This is a test",
    "stream": false
  }'
```

### Example response

```json
{
  "choices": [
    {
      "finish_reason": "stop",
      "index": 0,
      "logprobs": null,
      "text": "You are testing me!"
    }
  ],
  "created": 1716825108,
