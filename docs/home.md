![OVMS picture](ovms.png)

OpenVINO&trade; Model Server (OVMS) is a high-performance system for serving machine learning models. It is based on C++ for high scalability 
and optimized for Intel solutions, so that you can take advantage of all the power of the Intel® Xeon® processor or Intel’s AI accelerators 
and expose it over a network interface. OVMS uses the same architecture and API as [TensorFlow Serving](https://github.com/tensorflow/serving), 
while applying OpenVINO for inference execution. Inference service is provided via gRPC or REST API, making it easy to deploy new algorithms and AI experiments.

Model repositories may reside on a locally accessible file system (e.g. NFS), as well as online storage compatible with 
Google Cloud Storage (GCS), Amazon S3, or Azure Blob Storage. 

Read [release notes](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/model_server/releases) to find out what’s new.

Review the [Architecture concept](architecture.md) document for more details.

Key features: 
- support for multiple frameworks, such as Caffe, TensorFlow, MXNet, and ONNX
- online deployment of new [model versions](model_version_policy.md)
- [configuration updates in runtime](online_config_changes.md)
- support for AI accelerators, such as 
[Intel Movidius Myriad VPUs](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/openvino_docs_IE_DG_supported_plugins_VPU.html), 
[GPU](https://docs.openvino.ai/latest/openvino_docs_IE_DG_supported_plugins_GPU.html), and 
[HDDL](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_docs_IE_DG_supported_plugins_HDDL.html) 
- works with [Bare Metal Hosts](host.md) as well as [Docker containers](docker_container.md) 
- [model reshaping](shape_batch_size_and_layout.md) in runtime
- [directed Acyclic Graph Scheduler](dag_scheduler.md) - connecting multiple models to deploy complex processing solutions and reducing data transfer overhead
- [custom nodes in DAG pipelines](custom_node_development.md) - allowing model inference and data transformations to be implemented with a custom node C/C++ dynamic library
- [serving stateful models](stateful_models.md) - models that operate on sequences of data and maintain their state between inference requests
- [binary format of the input data](binary_input.md) - data can be sent in JPEG or PNG formats to reduce traffic and offload the client applications
- [model caching](model_cache.md) - cache the models on first load and re-use models from cache on subsequent loads


**Note:** OVMS has been tested on RedHat, CentOS, and Ubuntu. The latest publicly released docker images are based on Ubuntu and UBI.
They are stored in:
- [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/openvino/model_server)
- [RedHat Ecosystem Catalog](https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/intel/openvino-model-server/607833052937385fc98515de)


## Run OpenVINO Model Server

A demonstration on how to use OpenVINO Model Server can be found in [our quick-start guide](ovms_quickstart.md).
