# Introduction to OpenVINO&trade; Model Server

OpenVINO&trade; Model Server is a scalable, high-performance solution for serving machine learning models optimized for IntelÂ® architectures. The server provides an inference service via gRPC(Remote Procedure Calls) endpoint or REST API  making it easy to deploy new algorithms while keeping the same server architecture and APIs.

### Features of Model Server :

* Serves multiple models, or multiple versions of the same model simultaneously.
* Supports multiple Deep Learning frameworks such as Caffe*, TensorFlow*, MXNet* and ONNX*.
* Supports multi-worker configuration and parallel inference execution.
* Supports model reshaping at runtime.
* Speeds time-to-market as development of client code is reduced.
* Server can be deployed in a Kubernetes cluster allowing the inference service to scale horizontally and ensure high availability. [Kubernetes deployments](../deploy).
* The server supports reshaping models in runtime - [Model Reshaping](./shape_batch_size_and_layout.md).

### Model Server Components:
OpenVINO&trade; Model Server includes the following components:

1. Deep Learning Inference Engine
