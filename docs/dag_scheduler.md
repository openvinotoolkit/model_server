# Directed Acyclic Graph Scheduler in OpenVINO&trade; Model Server

## Introduction
OpenVINO&trade; Model Server provides possibility to create pipeline of models for execution in a single client request. 
Pipeline is a Directed Acyclic Graph with different nodes which define how to process each step of predict request. 
By using such pipeline, there is no need to return intermediate results of every model to the client. This allows avoiding the network overhead by minimizing the number of requests sent to model server. 
Each model output can be mapped to another model input. Since intermediate results are kept in server's RAM these can be reused by subsequent inferences which reduces overall latency.

## Node Types <a name="node-type"></a>
### Auxiliary Node Types
There are two special kinds of nodes - Request and Response node. Both of them are predefined and included in every pipeline definition you create:
*  Request node
    - This node defines which inputs are required to be sent via gRPC/REST request for pipeline usage. You can refer to it by node name: `request`.
* Response node
    - This node defines which outputs will be fetched from final pipeline state and packed into gRPC/REST response. 
    You cannot refer to it in your pipeline configuration since it is the pipeline final stage. To define final outputs fill `outputs` field. 

### Deep Learning node type

* DL model - this node contains underlying OpenVINO&trade; model and performs inference on selected target device. This can be defined in configuration file. 
    Each model input needs to be mapped to some node's `data_item` - input from gRPC/REST `request` or another `DL model` output. 
    Outputs of the node may be mapped to another node's inputs or the `response` node, meaning it will be exposed in gRPC/REST response. 

## Configuration file <a name="configuration-file"></a>

Pipelines configuration is to be placed in the same json file like the 
[models config file](docker_container.md#configfile).
While models are defined in section `model_config_list`, pipelines are to be configured in
section `pipeline_config_list`. 
Nodes in the pipelines can reference only the models configured in model_config_list section.

Below is depicted a basic pipeline section template:

```
{
    "pipeline_config_list": [
        {
            "name": "<pipeline name>",
            "inputs": ["<input1>",...],
            "nodes": [
                {
                    "name": "<node name>",
                    "model_name": <reference to the model>,
                    "type": "DL model",
                    "inputs": [
                        {"input": {"node_name": "request",  # reference to pipeline input
                                   "data_item": "<input1>"}}  # input name from the request
                    ], 
                    "outputs": [  # mapping the model output name to node output name
                        {"data_item": "<model output>",
                         "alias": "<node output name>"}
                    ] 
                }
            ],
            "outputs": [      # pipeline outputs
                {"label": {"node_name": "<node to return results>",
                           "data_item": "<node output name to return results>"}}
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

## Using the pipelines <a name="using-pipelines"></a>

Pipelines can use the same API like the models. There are exactly the same calls for running 
the predictions. The request format much much the pipeline definition inputs.

The pipeline configuration can be queried using [gRPC GetModelMetadata](model_server_grpc_api.md#model-metadata) calls and
[REST Metadata](model_server_rest_api.md#model-metadata).
It returns the definition of the pipelines inputs and outputs. 

Similarly, pipelines can be queried for their state using the calls [GetModelStatus](model_server_grpc_api.md#model-status)
and [REST Model Status](model_server_rest_api.md#model-status)

The only difference in using the pipelines and individual models is in version management. In all calls to the pipelines, 
version parameter is ignored. Pipelines are not versioned. Though, they can reference a particular version of the models in the graph.

## Current limitations <a name="current-limitations"></a>

- Models with ["auto" batch size or shape](shape_and_batch_size.md) cannot be referenced in pipeline
- Connected inputs and output for subsequent node models need to exactly match each other in terms of data shape and precision - 
there is no automatic conversion between input/output model precisions or layouts
- REST requests with no named format (JSON body with one unnamed input) are not supported
