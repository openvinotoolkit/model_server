# OpenVINO&trade; Model Server Developer Guide for Windows
This document describes windows development and compilation guide for ovms.exe binary.
This instruction was tested on Windows 11 and Windows 10 OS.

## List of disabled features on Windows model server:
- cloud storage for the models - to be added in next releases
- C-API interface - to be added in next releases
- DAG pipelines - legacy feature


# Install prerequisites
Following the steps below requires 40GB of free disk space.

## VISUAL BUILD TOOLS
Install build tools for VS:

https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vs_BuildTools.exe

Mark required options for installation:
- C++ Desktop development with C++
- Windows 11 SDK (10.0.26210.0)
- MSVC v143 CPP - VS 2022 C++ platform toolset.
- C++ CMake tools for Windows platform toolset.
- MSVC v142 CPP - VS 2022 C++ platform toolset.
- Optional Windows 11 SDK (10.0.26100.0) for Windows 10 compilation

## Power shell settings
Set Execution Policy to RemoteSigned
Open PowerShell as an administrator: Right-click on the Start button and select “Windows PowerShell (Admin)”.
Run the command:
```Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser -Force```

## Enable Developer mode in windows system settings
Follow instructions in the link below:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development

## Run Command Prompt
Press Windows Start and run the cmd.exe terminal as Administrator.
Run commands in this prompt is not stated otherwise.

## Pull OpenVINO Model Server source
> `Git` is required to complete this step. If you don't have it on your system, download it from https://git-scm.com/downloads/win and install before you continue.
Run below commands in terminal to clone model server repository:
```bat
mkdir C:\git
cd C:\git\
git clone https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/model_server.git
cd model_server
```

## Install dependencies
Run windows_install_build_dependencies.bat
This will install around 6 GB dependencies in the c:\opt directory:
- wet.exe, msys2 tools, Openvinotoolkit for GenAI, OpenCL headers, BoringSSL, bazel, Python 3.12.10, OpenCV, Go, Git-lfs, Curl

If error occurs during the script execution, please fix the error and rerun the script.
```bat
windows_install_build_dependencies.bat
```

## COMPILE
[WARNING] This step consumes up to 13GB of disk space. It can take up to 1h depending on host CPU and internet connection speed.
This default command compiles ovms.exe without python dependencies, just C++ binary with limited support for chat template processing.
```bat
windows_build.bat
```

Optionally you can build ovms.exe with python dependency that allows to use python chat templates for GENAI LLM support.
```bat
windows_build.bat opt --with_python
```
# Running unit tests - optional
The script compiles ovms_test binary with C++ only, downloads and converts test LLM models (src\tests\llm_testing).
```bat
windows_test.bat
```

The optional script compiles ovms_test binary with python support, downloads and converts test LLM models (src\tests\llm_testing) and installs Python torch and optimum.
```bat
windows_test.bat opt --with_python
```

# Creating deployment package
This step prepares ovms.zip deployment package from the build artifacts in the dist\windows\ directory. Run this script after successful compilation.
The default version creates C++ only version without Python dependency.
```bat
windows_create_package.bat
```

Optionally you can create a package with Python dependency. Note that to create valid package with Python, you need to build using `--with_python` flag in the previous step as well.
```bat
windows_create_package.bat opt --with_python
```

# Test the Deployment
You can follow the [baremetal deployment guide](deploying_server_baremetal.md) for information how to deploy and use the ovms.zip package.

# Developer Command Prompt
For building ovms.exe and running ovms_test.exe with manual bazel commands you must setup proper environment variables.
Run the batch script in new "Developer Command Prompt for VS 2022" terminal:
```bat
cd c:\git\model_server
windows_setupvars.bat
```

Rebuild unit tests:
```bat
bazel --output_user_root=c:\opt build --config=windows --action_env OpenVINO_DIR=c:\opt\genai/runtime/cmake --jobs=%NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS% --verbose_failures //src:ovms_test 2>&1 | tee win_build_test.log
```

Download LLMs
```bat
%cd%\windows_prepare_llm_models.bat %cd%\src\test\llm_testing
```

Change tests configs to windows:
```bat
python windows_change_test_configs.py
```

Run specific unit tests by setting gtest_filter:
```bat
%cd%\bazel-bin\src\ovms_test.exe --gtest_filter=* 2>&1 | tee win_full_test.log
```
