# Prediction Example with an ONNX Model {#ovms_demo_using_onnx_model}

Steps are similar to when you work with IR model format. Model Server accepts ONNX models as well with no differences in versioning. Locate ONNX model file in separate model version directory.
Below is a complete functional use case using Python 3.7 or higher. 
For this example let's use a public [ONNX ResNet](https://github.com/onnx/models/tree/main/validated/vision/classification/resnet) model - resnet50-caffe2-v1-9.onnx model.

This model requires additional [preprocessing function](https://github.com/onnx/models/tree/main/validated/vision/classification/resnet#preprocessing). Preprocessing can be performed in the client by manipulating data before sending the request. Preprocessing can be also delegated to the server by creating a [DAG](../../../docs/dag_scheduler.md) and using a custom processing node. Both methods will be explained below.

<a href="#client-side">Option 1: Adding preprocessing to the client side</a>  
<a href="#server-side">Option 2: Adding preprocessing to the server side (building DAG)</a>

## Option 1: Adding preprocessing to the client side <a name="client-side"></a>

Clone the repository and enter using_onnx_model directory
```bash
git clone https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/model_server.git
cd model_server/demos/using_onnx_model/python
```

Prepare workspace with the model by running: 
```bash
make client_preprocessing
```

You should see `workspace` directory created with the following content:
```bash
workspace/
└── resnet50-onnx
    └── 1
        └── resnet50-caffe2-v1-9.onnx

```

Start the OVMS container with single model instance:
```bash
docker run -d -u $(id -u):$(id -g) -v $(pwd)/workspace:/workspace -p 9001:9001 openvino/model_server:latest \
--model_path /workspace/resnet50-onnx --model_name resnet --port 9001
```

Install python client dependencies:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

The `onnx_model_demo.py` script can run inference both with and without performing preprocessing. Since in this variant we want to run preprocessing on the client side let's set `--run_preprocessing` flag.

Run the client with preprocessing:
```bash
python3 onnx_model_demo.py --service_url localhost:9001 --run_preprocessing
Running with preprocessing on client side
../../common/static/images/bee.jpeg (1, 3, 224, 224) ; data range: -2.117904 : 2.64
Class is with highest score: 309
Detected class name: bee
```

## Option 2: Adding preprocessing to the server side (building a DAG) <a name="server-side"></a>

Prepare workspace with the model, preprocessing node library and configuration file by running:
```bash
make server_preprocessing
```

You should see `workspace` directory created with the following content:
```bash
workspace/
├── config.json
├── lib
│   └── libcustom_node_image_transformation.so
└── resnet50-onnx
    └── 1
        └── resnet50-caffe2-v1-9.onnx
```

Start the OVMS container with a configuration file option:
```bash
docker run -d -u $(id -u):$(id -g) -v $(pwd)/workspace:/workspace -p 9001:9001 openvino/model_server:latest \
--config_path /workspace/config.json --port 9001
```

The `onnx_model_demo.py` script can run inference both with and without performing preprocessing. Since in this variant preprocessing is done by the model server (via custom node), there's no need to perform any image preprocessing on the client side. In that case, run without `--run_preprocessing` option. See [preprocessing function](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/model_server/blob/main/demos/using_onnx_model/python/onnx_model_demo.py#L26-L33) run in the client.

Run the client without preprocessing:
```bash
python3 onnx_model_demo.py --service_url localhost:9001
Running without preprocessing on client side
Class is with highest score: 309
Detected class name: bee
```

## Node parameters explanation
Additional preprocessing step applies a division and an subtraction to each pixel value in the image. This calculation is configured by passing two parameters to _image transformation_ custom node in [config.json](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/model_server/blob/main/demos/using_onnx_model/python/config.json#L32-L33):
```
"params": {
  ...
  "mean_values": "[123.675,116.28,103.53]",
  "scale_values": "[58.395,57.12,57.375]",
  ...
}
```
For each pixel, the custom node subtracted `123.675` from blue value, `116.28` from green value and `103.53` from red value. Next, it divides in the same color order using `58.395`, `57.12`, `57.375` values. This way we match the image data to the input required by onnx model.
