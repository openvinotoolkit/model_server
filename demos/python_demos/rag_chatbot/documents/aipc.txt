An AI PC is one that can effectively run all the different types of AI applications that might need to run on a PC, especially including Microsoft CoPilot, which can improve user productivity without sacrificing battery life, security or privacy. The AI PC will solve the growth challenges of AI applications and the challenges of cloud-only AI applications have today by offering local performant and efficient AI computing with little to no cost to the developers. The AI PC will not only usher the next generation of the PC platform but redefine what it means to work on a PC and how powerful it can be as a productivity platform. AI-acceleration now needs to be a component of people's PC buying decisions.
