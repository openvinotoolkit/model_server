# Benchmark Client (Python) {#ovms_demo_benchmark_app}

## Introduction

The benchmark client introduced in this directory is written in Python 3. Benchmark client uses TFServing API and KServe API to communicate with model servers. It is recommended to use the benchmark client as a docker container. Prior to transmission, the client downloads metadata from the server, which contains a list of available models, their versions as well as accepted input and output shapes. Then it generates tensors containing random data with shapes matched to the models served by the service. Both the length of the dataset and the workload duration can be specified independently. The synthetic data created is then served in a loop iterating over the dataset until the workload length is satisfied. As the main role of the client is performance measurement all aspects unrelated to throughput and/or latency are ignored. This means the client does not validate the received responses nor does it estimate accuracy as these activities would negatively affect the measured performance metrics on the client side.

In addition to the standard data format, the client also supports stateful models (recognizing dependencies between consecutive
inference requests) as well as binary input for select file formats (PNG and JPEG).

Furthermore the client supports multiple precisions: `FP16`, `FP32`, `FP64`, `INT8`, `INT16`, `INT32`, `INT64`, `UINT8`, `UINT16`, `UINT32`, `UINT64`. Both channel types, insecure and certificate secured, are supported. Secrets/certificates have to be mounted on a separated volume as well as their path has to be specified by command line. The secure connection can be used, for example, to benchmark the Nginx OVMS plugin, which can be build from public source with the built-in Nginx reverse proxy load balancer.

A single docker container can run many parallel clients in separate processes. Measured metrics (especially throughput, latency,
and counters) are collected from all client processes and then combined upon which they can be printed in JSON format/syntax for
the entire parallel workload. If the docker container is run in the deamon mode the final logs can be shown using the `docker logs`
command. Results can also be exported to a Mongo database. In order to do this the appropriate identification metadata has to
be specified in the command line.

## OVMS Deployment

First of all, download a model and create an appropriate directory tree. For example, for some resnet 50 model from Intel's Open Model Zoo:

```bash
mkdir -p workspace/resnet50-binary-0001/1
cd workspace/resnet50-binary-0001/1
wget https://storage.openvinotoolkit.org/repositories/open_model_zoo/2022.1/models_bin/2/resnet50-binary-0001/FP32-INT1/resnet50-binary-0001.xml
wget https://storage.openvinotoolkit.org/repositories/open_model_zoo/2022.1/models_bin/2/resnet50-binary-0001/FP32-INT1/resnet50-binary-0001.bin
cd ../../..
```

Let's start OVMS before building and running the benchmark client as follows:
```bash
docker run -p 30001:30001 -p 30002:30002 -d -v ${PWD}/workspace:/workspace openvino/model_server --model_path \
                     /workspace/resnet50-binary-0001 --model_name resnet50-binary-0001 --port 30001 --rest_port 30002
```
where a model directory looks like that:
```bash
workspace
└── resnet50-binary-0001
    └── 1
        ├── resnet50-binary-0001.bin
        └── resnet50-binary-0001.xml
```

## Build Client Docker Image

To build the docker image and tag it as `benchmark_client` run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/model_server.git
cd model_server/demos/benchmark/python
docker build . -t benchmark_client
```

## Selected Commands

To check available options use `-h`, `--help` switches:
```bash
  docker run benchmark_client --help

usage: main.py [-h] [-i ID] [-c CONCURRENCY] [-a SERVER_ADDRESS]
               [-p GRPC_PORT] [-r REST_PORT] [-l] [-b [BS [BS ...]]]
               [-s [SHAPE [SHAPE ...]]] [-d [DATA [DATA ...]]] [-j]

               [--metadata_timeout METADATA_TIMEOUT] [-Y DB_ENDPOINT]
               [-y [DB_METADATA [DB_METADATA ...]]] [--print_all] [--print_summary]
               [--print_time] [--report_warmup] [--certs_dir CERTS_DIR]
               [-q STATEFUL_LENGTH] [--stateful_id STATEFUL_ID]
               [--stateful_hop STATEFUL_HOP] [--sync_interval SYNC_INTERVAL]
               [--quantile_list [QUANTILE_LIST [QUANTILE_LIST ...]]]
               [--hist_factor HIST_FACTOR] [--hist_base HIST_BASE]
               [--internal_version] [--unbuffered] [--api {TFS,KFS,REST}]

This is benchmarking client which uses TFS/KFS API to communicate with
OVMS/TFS/KFS-based-services.
```

The version can be checked by using `--internal_version` switch as follows:
```bash
  docker run benchmark_client --internal_version

  2.6
```

The client is able to download the metadata of the served models. If you are
unsure which models and versions are served and what status they have, you can
list this information by specifying the `--list_models` switch (also a short
form `-l` is available):
```bash
docker run --network host benchmark_client -a localhost -r 30002 --list_models
```

```
Client 2.6
NO_PROXY=localhost no_proxy=localhost python3 /ovms_benchmark_client/main.py -a localhost -r 30002 --list_models
XI worker: try to send request to endpoint: http://localhost:30002/v1/config
XI worker: received status code is 200.
XI worker: found models and their status:
XI worker:  model: resnet50-binary-0001, version: 1 - AVAILABLE

```
Names, model shape, as well as information about data types of both inputs and
outputs can also be downloaded for all available models using the same listing
switches and adding `-m <model-name>` and `-v <model-version>` to the command
line. The option `-i` is used only to add a prefix to the standard output with a name
of an application instance. For example:
```bash
docker run --network host benchmark_client -a localhost -r 30002 -l -m resnet50-binary-0001 -p 30001 -i id
```

```
Client 2.6
NO_PROXY=localhost no_proxy=localhost python3 /ovms_benchmark_client/main.py -a localhost -r 30002 -l -m resnet50-binary-0001 -p 30001 -i id
XW id: Finished execution. If you want to run inference remove --list_models.
XI id: try to send request to endpoint: http://localhost:30002/v1/config
XI id: received status code is 200.
XI id: found models and their status:
XI id:  model: resnet50-binary-0001, version: 1 - AVAILABLE
XI id: request for metadata of model resnet50-binary-0001...
XI id: Metadata for model resnet50-binary-0001 is downloaded...
XI id: set version of model resnet50-binary-0001: 1
XI id: inputs:
XI id:  0:
XI id:   name: 0
XI id:   dtype: DT_FLOAT
XI id:   tensorShape: {'dim': [{'size': '1'}, {'size': '3'}, {'size': '224'}, {'size': '224'}]}
XI id: outputs:
XI id:  1463:
XI id:   name: 1463
XI id:   dtype: DT_FLOAT
XI id:   tensorShape: {'dim': [{'size': '1'}, {'size': '1000'}]}

```
Be sure the model name specified is identical to the model name shown when using
the `--list_models` parameter. A model version is not required but it can be added
when multiple versions are available for a specific model name.

The introduced benchmark client supports generation of requests with multiple and
different batch sizes in a single workload. The switches `-b`, `--bs` can be used
to specify this parameter.

The workload can be generated only if its length is specified by iteration number
`-n`, `--steps_number` or duration length `-t`, `--duration`. To see report also on warmup time window use `--report_warmup` switch. Example for 8 requests
will be generated as follows (remember to add `--print_all` to show metrics in stdout):
```bash
docker run --network host benchmark_client -a localhost -r 30002 -m resnet50-binary-0001 -p 30001 -n 8 --report_warmup --print_all
```
```

Summary of the benchmark results can be viewed by enabling ```--print_summary``` option as below (with ```--quantile_list 0.5 0.9 0.95```)
```bash
docker run --network host benchmark_client -a localhost -r 8000 -m face-detection-retail-0005 -p 9000 -s 2 3 300 300 -t 20 --print_summary --quantile_list 0.5 .9 .95
